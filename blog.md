# Fuzzing Anchor Programs on Solana with Trident

Fuzzing is an automated software testing technique that involves providing random, unexpected inputs to a program to find bugs and crashes. It is a powerful way to uncover vulnerabilities that may be missed by other testing methods.

In this video, we will explore how to use [Trident](https://github.com/ackee-blockchain/Trident), a fuzz testing framework for Solana and Anchor programs. Trident makes it easy to set up the testing environment and generate fuzz tests for your programs.

## What is Fuzzing?

Fuzzing involves passing malformed or random data to a program's inputs to see if it crashes or behaves unexpectedly. The key idea is to test edge cases and scenarios that developers may not have considered.

The main benefits of fuzzing include:

- Finding bugs missed by other tests 
- Increasing test coverage
- Detecting crashes caused by unhandled runtime errors
- Testing different combinations of inputs and instruction orderings

However, fuzzing also has some challenges:

- Setting up the fuzzing environment can be complicated
- Developing the testing harness takes time
- Analyzing the large amount of data generated can be challenging

## Introducing Trident

Trident aims to lower the barrier to entry for fuzz testing Solana Anchor programs. It is built on top of the well-known Honggfuzz fuzzing library.

Key features of Trident include:

- Automatically sets up the testing environment 
- Generates the fuzzing test harness
- Provides a convenient CLI to run and debug tests
- Open source Rust crate

## How to Fuzz Test an Anchor Program

To fuzz test an Anchor program, we need to consider the following input areas:

1. Instruction data - the program-specific parameters passed to an instruction 
2. Instruction accounts - the accounts read from and written to by the program
3. Instruction invocation order - the ordering of multiple instructions

The fuzzer will generate pseudo-random values for instruction data and accounts. It can also test different orderings of instruction invocations to find unexpected crashes.

## Trident Fuzzing Lifecycle

The Trident fuzzing lifecycle consists of the following key steps:

1. Generate a random sequence of instructions to execute in each iteration
2. For each instruction:
    - Determine the accounts to pass using the `get_accounts` method
    - Determine the instruction data using the `get_data` method  
    - Take a snapshot of the accounts before execution
    - Invoke the instruction
    - If successful, perform custom invariant checks using the `check` method
    - Detect any crash and save the inputs to a crash file
3. Continue iterating until:  
    - Max iterations reached
    - Crash detected and `exit_on_crash` enabled
    - Manually interrupted by user

In the next part, we will walk through a hands-on example of using Trident to fuzz test a simple Anchor program. Stay tuned!

## Implementing the Fuzz Test

Now let's walk through the steps to implement the fuzz test for our simple Anchor program. 

### Specifying Accounts to Reuse

In the `FuzzAccounts` struct, we need to specify the types of accounts we want to store and reuse. Looking at the program code, we see that:

- The `author` account is a signer, so we will store it as a `KeyPair`.
- The `escrow` account is a PDA with a specific data type, so we define it as `PdaStore`.
- The `receiver` account is also a signer keypair.
- The `system_program` always uses the same account, so we don't need to store different variants.

After specifying the account types, we implement the mandatory `get_accounts` and `get_data` methods for each instruction.

### Implementing get_data and get_accounts 

For the `initialize` instruction's `get_data` method:

- Create the `receiver` keypair using the `get_or_create_account` helper and the randomly generated account ID. 
- Pass the `receiver`'s public key and amount from the fuzzed instruction data.

The `withdraw` instruction has no parameters so `get_data` can be left empty.

In the `get_accounts` method for `initialize`:

- Create the `author` keypair in a similar way as `receiver`.
- Calculate the `escrow` PDA using the expected seeds.
- Pass the `system_program` ID directly.

For the `withdraw` instruction's `get_accounts`:

- Reuse the `receiver` and `escrow` accounts.
- Pass arbitrary IDs for `author` since it's not a signer.

### Customizing Instruction Generation

To ensure the `escrow` account is always initialized before `withdraw`, we implement the `pre_instructions` method to always include `initialize` first.

We can also restrict the range of generated account IDs using the `arbitrary` crate to generate values between 1-3. This reduces the number of accounts and speeds up testing.

### Adding Invariant Checks

Finally, we add a custom invariant check in the `withdraw` instruction's `check` method. 

The key invariant is that the `receiver` account specified in `withdraw` must match the `receiver` stored in the `escrow` account. If not, the receiver's balance should not increase.

We express this check by comparing the `receiver` pubkey and `escrow.receiver`, returning a custom "balance mismatch" error if the condition is not met.

## Running the Fuzz Test

With the test implemented, we can run it using:

```sh
trident fuzz run
```

After about 50 seconds, the fuzzer detects a crash! The failing input sequence is saved to a crash file for further debugging.

To replay the crash in a debugger, we run:

```sh
trident fuzz run debug ./crash-file
```

Inspecting the logs, we see the invariant check failed on a `withdraw` instruction. The `receiver` account used (index 1) differed from the one stored in `escrow` during `initialize` (index 2), indicating a vulnerability in the program.

## Conclusion

In this hands-on example, we successfully implemented a fuzz test using Trident to find a bug in a simple Anchor program. By specifying accounts, customizing instruction generation, and adding invariant checks, we created an effective test that quickly uncovered a flaw.

Fuzz testing is a powerful technique to improve the security and reliability of Solana programs. Trident makes it easier than ever to get started.
